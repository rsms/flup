# Flup

Flup is a simple app for uploading images to Flickr by drag-and-drop and to quickly get the URL for the image file. Perfect for people who use Flickr to host images used on other sites (e.g. for blogging etc).

This was a quick hack done in a few hours so it's far from polished and have very few features. For instance, only one single image can be uploaded at a time.

## Installation

1. [Download and install the latest version](https://github.com/rsms/flup/downloads)

2. Start the app and in the main menu, select "Authenticate with Flickr..." and follow the instructions on the Flickr web site that opens up.

3. When you're done, you should automatically arrive back to Flup.

## Usage

When a picture is dropped on Flup it's immediately uploaded. By default the uploaded image will be private (that is, only visible to you).
